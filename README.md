# when2meet
Each semester, I'm tasked with organizing two meetings involving more than 15 individuals. Within our group, each person is only required to attend one of these two sessions. A colleague suggested employing disjoint set coverage in Python to address this challenge. This repository serves two main purposes: 

-1 It dowloads data from when2meet, and 

-2 It uses Python to identify the two meetings with the highest degree of distinct participation.
